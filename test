Business Requirement Document (BRD)

Executive Summary:
This Business Requirement Document (BRD) outlines the business need, objectives, and requirements for the proposed initiative. It is intended to provide a comprehensive and review-ready foundation for stakeholder validation and downstream development. The purpose of this initiative is to address identified business challenges, achieve strategic objectives, and deliver measurable value to the organization.

Business Objectives:
1. Clearly define and document business requirements for the initiative.
2. Align requirements with organizational goals and success criteria.
3. Enable efficient stakeholder review and validation.
4. Ensure traceability and readiness for development and implementation.

Problem Statement:
The organization faces challenges related to incomplete, ambiguous, or unstructured requirements, leading to misalignment, rework, and project delays. This initiative aims to resolve these issues by establishing a standardized, traceable, and actionable requirements framework.

Scope:
In-Scope:
- Requirements gathering and documentation
- Stakeholder engagement and validation
- Traceability matrix creation
- Functional, non-functional, and compliance requirements
- Use case identification and documentation
Out-of-Scope:
- Solution design and implementation
- Post-launch support
- Training and change management

Stakeholders:
- Business Sponsor: Accountable for overall initiative success
- Product Owner: Defines business needs and priorities
- Business Analyst: Leads requirements gathering and documentation
- Development Team: Consumes requirements for solution design
- QA Team: Validates requirements against test cases
- Compliance Officer: Ensures regulatory adherence

Assumptions:
- All key stakeholders are available for requirements validation.
- Business objectives and success criteria are clearly defined.
- Existing documentation is accessible and up-to-date.
- Dependencies and constraints are identified early in the process.

Constraints:
- Budget limitations for requirements workshops and documentation tools
- Timeline constraints for stakeholder review cycles
- Resource availability (analysts, SMEs, stakeholders)
- Technology limitations impacting requirements traceability

Use Case Overview:
1. Requirements Gathering: Collect and analyze business inputs
2. Requirements Normalization: Structure and clarify requirements
3. Stakeholder Review: Facilitate validation and feedback
4. Traceability Matrix Creation: Map requirements to objectives and use cases

Use Case Details:
Use Case 1: Requirements Gathering
- Actor: Business Analyst
- Description: Collects business inputs from stakeholders
- Flow: Initiate workshop > Gather inputs > Document findings > Review with stakeholders
- Exceptions: Stakeholder unavailability, incomplete inputs

Use Case 2: Requirements Normalization
- Actor: Business Analyst
- Description: Structures and clarifies requirements
- Flow: Analyze inputs > Normalize language > Categorize requirements > Review with Product Owner
- Exceptions: Ambiguous requirements, conflicting inputs

Use Case 3: Stakeholder Review
- Actor: Product Owner, Stakeholders
- Description: Validates documented requirements
- Flow: Distribute BRD > Collect feedback > Update documentation > Finalize requirements
- Exceptions: Delayed feedback, unresolved issues

Use Case 4: Traceability Matrix Creation
- Actor: Business Analyst
- Description: Maps requirements to objectives and use cases
- Flow: Identify linkages > Document traceability > Review with QA Team
- Exceptions: Missing linkages, incomplete mapping

Functional Requirements:
1. The BRD must capture all explicit and implicit business requirements.
2. Requirements must be categorized as functional, non-functional, or compliance.
3. Each requirement must be traceable to business objectives and use cases.
4. The BRD must support stakeholder review and feedback.
5. The document must be version-controlled and auditable.

Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Performance: The BRD template must enable efficient documentation and review cycles.
2. Security: Sensitive business information must be protected and access-controlled.
3. Usability: The BRD must be clear, concise, and easy to navigate for all stakeholders.
4. Scalability: The template must support future enhancements and additional requirements.
5. Compliance: The BRD must adhere to relevant industry standards and regulatory requirements.

Dependencies:
- Availability of business inputs and documentation
- Stakeholder engagement and timely feedback
- Access to requirements management tools
- Integration with existing project management systems

Risks and Mitigation:
Risk 1: Incomplete or ambiguous requirements
- Impact: Project delays, rework
- Likelihood: Medium
- Mitigation: Conduct thorough workshops, peer reviews

Risk 2: Stakeholder unavailability
- Impact: Delayed validation
- Likelihood: Medium
- Mitigation: Schedule reviews in advance, provide remote options

Risk 3: Technology limitations
- Impact: Reduced traceability
- Likelihood: Low
- Mitigation: Use standardized documentation tools

Open Questions:
1. Are all key stakeholders identified and engaged?
2. Is existing documentation complete and accessible?
3. What are the specific compliance requirements?
4. Are there any technology constraints impacting documentation?

Readiness Assessment:
- Requirements documentation is in progress and aligned with organizational objectives.
- Stakeholder review cycles are scheduled and resources allocated.
- Traceability matrix is being developed to ensure alignment and completeness.
- Risks and dependencies are documented and mitigation strategies in place.
- The BRD is ready for initial stakeholder review and feedback.
